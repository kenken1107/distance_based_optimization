# Nearest-neighbor-based-optimization-framework

### What can you do with this framework?
* You can perform "Nearest-Neighbor based optimization" on your dataset in which there are Manipulated Variables(MVs)*, Disturbance Variables(DVs)*, and Process Variables(PVs)*.

### How can you perform this optimization?
* Copy all the folder "code_program" and "basedata_settings" and paste these to your local environment under single folder
* Put your dataset at “../basedata_setting”
* Make settings for your optimization on "optimization_settings.xlxs"
* Set the path of your location in "search_optimization_main.py“ at “../code_program/”


### With this framework, you can get a message from your dataset: 
* Given Dvs(Amb.Temperature, Amb.Humidity, Specific Coal Properties) within a small difference, when you maximize "Boiler Efficiency", what kind of behavior can be observed in MVs(Air Flow on A-side, Air Flow on B-side, Blade Angle on the entrance of boiler, and etc) and 
PVs(Boilder outlet Temperature, Nox Emission, CO Emission, and etc)? 


Variables of your choice that cannot be manipulated
